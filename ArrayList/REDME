ArrayList:

In Java, an ArrayList is a resizable array implementation of the List interface provided by the Java Collections Framework. It's part of the java.util package. Unlike arrays, which have a fixed size, ArrayList can dynamically grow and shrink in size as elements are added or removed. This makes it a more flexible data structure for handling collections of objects.

Key features and characteristics of ArrayList:

1.Dynamic Size: As mentioned, an ArrayList can dynamically increase or decrease its size based on the number of elements it contains.
2.Random Access: Elements within an ArrayList can be accessed using their index position. This allows for fast retrieval of elements based on their position in the list.
3.Generics: ArrayList supports generics, which means it can hold elements of a specified type. This ensures type safety and avoids explicit type casting when retrieving elements from the list.
4.Iterable: ArrayList implements the Iterable interface, which means it can be easily traversed using iterators or enhanced for loops.
5.Not Synchronized: This class is roughly equivalent to Vector, except it is unsynchronized.
